<p align="center">Command line system information tool written in C.<p>

 # Requirements

  * - libcpuid (>= 0.4.1-1.1) > Not yet required...
  * - gcc
  * - make

# Installing 

onload requires to be built from source. This makes it highly customiziable
and portable since you can configure settings through the headers.

To install run
```console
make
sudo make install
```

# Note

This project is far from complete and needs a lot of work to be a complete
command line system information tool.
I fully intend to make this program a complete library and tool but school and work are a priority.
